# Introduction

Hidrogen production has the pontential to be a 

# Objective

* The main objective of this project is to develop a tool that helps with the 
selection of an electrolyser.

# Methodology
* For calculating the following procedure is performed:


## Formulas

### Yearly revenue
The amount of money that is generated by the electrolyser during a year is given
by the following formula:
$$
V_i = E_{year}  \left( \frac{H2_{price}(t)}{\eta} - E_{cost}(t)\right) - OPEX  
$$

* $V_i$: yearly revenue in $\text{USD}$
* $E_{year}$: yearly energy produced in $\text{kWh}$
* $H2_{price}(t)$:  Price of hydrogen at year $t$ in $\frac{\text{USD}}{\text{kg}}$
* $\eta$: efficiency of the electrolyser in  $\frac{\text{kWh}}{\text{kg}}$
* $E_{cost}(t)$:  Energy cost of electrolysis at year $t$ in $\frac{\text{USD}}{\text{kWh}}$
* $OPEX$:  Operating expenses in $\text{USD}$
